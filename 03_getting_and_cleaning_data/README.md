## "Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project"


This is the course project for the Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Download the dataset to separate directory.
2. Loads test and train data.
3. Merge test & train.
4. Subset columns with mean or standard deviation data.
5. Adds subject and activity data to test & train data.
6. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
variable for each subject and activity pair.
